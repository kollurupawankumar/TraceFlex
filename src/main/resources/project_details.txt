Explanation of Key Components:
Configuration Enhancements:

Added include.methods for method-level instrumentation

Added RocksDB path configuration

Introduced MethodPattern to handle class.method combinations

Added flush interval for periodic reporting

RocksDB Integration:

RocksDBManager handles database initialization and operations

Uses Column Families for better data organization

Serializes MethodStats objects for storage

Automatic cleanup on JVM shutdown

Enhanced Instrumentation:

Method-level matching using wildcard patterns

Bytecode injection for both method entry and exit

Transaction tracing with call stack management

Separate handling of individual metrics and transaction aggregates

Transaction Context:

Thread-local storage for transaction correlation

Tracks method call hierarchy using a stack

Aggregates statistics across transaction boundaries

Automatically flushes to RocksDB when transaction completes

Performance Considerations:

Batch writes through periodic flushing

In-memory aggregation before RocksDB writes

Column Family usage for efficient querying

Asynchronous reporting thread

Data Model:

Individual method metrics stored with methodId as key

Transaction metrics stored with UUID as key

MethodStats captures count, total time, min/max durations

This implementation provides:

Method-level instrumentation configuration

Transaction tracing across distributed calls

Persistent metric storage with RocksDB

Thread-safe metric collection

Low-overhead instrumentation

Configurable flush intervals

Automatic resource cleanup

Rich method statistics collection

The agent can be extended with additional features like:

Custom serialization formats

Advanced query capabilities

Metric aggregation filters

Anomaly detection hooks

Distributed tracing correlation



Key Components Explained:
Dependencies:

ASM: Core bytecode manipulation library

RocksDB JNI: Native RocksDB bindings for Java

SLF4J: Logging facade (marked as provided to avoid conflicts)

JUnit: Testing framework

Build Configuration:

Java 11 compatibility

UTF-8 encoding for source files

Resource filtering for configuration files

Assembly Plugin:

Creates a fat JAR with all dependencies

Sets required manifest attributes for Java agents:

Premain-Class: Entry point for the agent

Can-Redefine-Classes: Allows class redefinition

Can-Retransform-Classes: Enables class retransformation

Boot-Class-Path: Ensures proper dependency loading

RocksDB Considerations:

The rocksdbjni dependency includes native libraries

Requires compatible architecture (automatically handled)

Persistent storage location configured via properties

This configuration ensures:

Proper packaging of all required dependencies

Correct Java agent manifest configuration

Compatibility with Java 11+ applications

Efficient RocksDB storage integration

Minimal classloading conflicts with target applications

Note: For production use, you might want to add:

ProGuard configuration for code shrinking

Proper logging implementation

Additional error handling

Metric serialization optimizations
